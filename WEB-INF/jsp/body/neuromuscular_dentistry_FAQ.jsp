	<h3>What is occlusion?</h3>
	<p>Occlusion refers to the proper alignment of teeth when the jaw
		bones are brought together. Correct occlusion is a key component in
		every dental treatment. Neuromuscular Dentists incorporate the
		importance of achieving correct occlusion through manipulation of jaw
		muscles and temporomandibular joints.</p>
	</br>
	<h3>What happens when your bite is misaligned?</h3>
	<p>A bite is misaligned when the upper and lower teeth fail to come
		together symbiotically. When misalignment occurs, it can cause a whole
		slew of problems for you, including tooth shifting, pain and soreness,
		speech problems, and enamel wear and tear. Because the jaw joints and
		muscles have to work overtime to bring teeth together for chewing or
		other activities, they become stressed and create headaches, tension
		and other symptoms. Stiff jaw joints and strained muscles are no fun,
		and can very negative effects on your natural teeth and restorations.</p>

	<h3>How do I know if I have a neuromuscular problem?</h3>
	<p>If you experience any one or combination of symptoms described
		on our neuromuscular page, you may have an actual TMJ / TMD problem.
		You’ll only know for sure, however, after a series of high tech
		diagnostic tests.</p>
	</br>
	<h3>What is a "locking" episode?</h3>
	<p>The jaw joints may lock up while opening or closing the jaw. As
		scary as it sounds, it is only temporary and can be prevented with
		expert neuromuscular treatment. To “unlock” the jaw, it usually just
		takes a little wiggling.</p>
	</br>
	<h3>What is a limited range of opening?</h3>
	<p>Limited range of opening is a self-test you can use to help
		determine if you might need to see a TMJ / TMD specialist. Try to open
		your mouth as wide as possible. See if you can fit your last three
		fingers vertically into your mouth opening. If you can only fit a
		maximum of two fingers, you are said to have a limited range of
		opening and may need neuromuscular treatment.</p>
	</br>
	<h3>What does a clicking or popping sound in the jaw indicate?</h3>
	<p>Clicking or popping occurs when the jaw joints are not working
		properly. Your jaw joints may be excessive strain and trauma, and the
		unusual sounds are a result of tissue, joints, muscle and bone making
		incorrect contact with each other.</p>
	</br>
	<h3>Is ear pain an indication of a neuromuscular problem?</h3>
	<p>Ringing in the ear, called tinnitus, or ear pain may indicate a
		problem with the jaw joints. Because the eardrum reaches back to the
		area where jaw joints hinge, ear pain can often result from excessive
		strain on the temporomandibular joints.</p>
