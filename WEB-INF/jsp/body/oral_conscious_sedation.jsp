	<p>If the idea of going to the dentist for a procedure brings on
		feelings of fear or anxiety there are options to ease the anxiety.
		Oral conscious sedation is as easy as taking an aspirin and you will
		feel relaxed and at ease. Oral conscious sedation does not "knock you
		out" like some other forms of anesthesia. You will remain awake during
		your procedure, but you will be in a heightened state of relaxation.
		It is also possible that you will not remember part, or all, of your
		procedure.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Oral conscious sedation is extremely safe and easy. It is much
		less expensive than other forms of sedation, and you will be able to
		talk and breathe on your own during the procedure. It also makes long
		or complex procedures seem shorter, allowing you to have all of your
		work done in a single visit. As an added precaution a local anesthetic
		will be given to the area that is being worked on to ensure that there
		is no pain. You will need to have someone drive you to and from the
		office if you use oral conscious sedation for your safety.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Don't wait any longer to have necessary dental work performed
		because you are nervous. Ask your dentist about oral conscious
		sedation to see if it is right for you.</p>
